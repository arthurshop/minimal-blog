Like a lot of people, I am now using VS Code as my main editor on Mac OS. And I try to automate my tasks as much as possible, so I create aliases in my Terminal (yes, not something new, but you got the context), including one for _VSCoce_ aka `code`.

## Changing the alias for VS Code

I am using zsh so my aliases should be in `~/.zshrc` but I had an issue and `code .` was not opening VS Code but giving me an error like this one `zsh: command not found: code`

I found the solution on Stackoverflow ([here for the curious](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29955500/code-is-not-working-in-on-the-command-line-for-visual-studio-code-on-os-x-ma)).

What helped me was: 

1. Going to VSCode
2. Use the `⇧ + ⌘ + P ` to open the _Command Palette_
3. Select _Uninstall 'code' command from PATH_
4. Instaling it again thanks to _Install 'code' command from PATH_
