Don't get me wrong, I don't have the pretention to know Ruby or how to code in Ruby. It's just a way of saying that "if you want to do something, just do it!" I am sharing "simple" knowledge stuff for everyone and for sharing knowledge.

## Let me tell you a story about Ruby

One day, we had one of our Hackhathon at my current company & we werw short on dev support for an idea I had; so I said to myself "why not try to build something that I could connect to our exisiting tool".

The goald was to connect our website and search for some way to optimize our Interlinking strategy. I will not go into to much details about the how and what of this tool (internal knowledge guys 😇); But I will explain my journey into Ruby.

> Interlinking: the process of linking 2 pages on the same property/website. The end goal is to help crawler discover these pages and enhance the visibility (and the Organic ranks) of a specific page.

## First step: What is Ruby?

I heard of Ruby in the past, but that was really blurry for me. So the first thing I did is using a search engine and find official website and good articles about this language. Following that, the second step was to search on our internal documentation for coursese, tutorials, ...

I found great learning tool thanks to CodecAemy (in addition to path available for employee at Shopify). Let me share with you some of the courses I took and the thing I learned!

## Learning Ruby: the courses 101, 102 and 103

The goal of these introduction courses were to understand the structure of the language and how variables are working

### Learning Ruby 101

The first course for me was "quite logic and easy" since I alreay knew some basis in R, Python and SQL. Especially knowing basic Python help me I must say.

#### Installing ruby

For this article, I will not display how to install Ruby on your machine: also that could depend on the OS you have, its version and what you are currently using!

#### Commenting in Ruby

Commenting content is really useful, especially when you are learning, I found it really easy to remember specific lines of code and what they do. This was my first learning really and so to comment in Ruby, you could use either `#` or `=begin` and `=end` depending on if you want to comment one or several lines of code.

```ruby
# Comment in Ruby with `#` foir single line
```

I'll use this first one to remember some stuff along the way


```ruby
=begin
Comment in ruby with 
`=begin`
and
`=end`
for multiple line and it is case sensitive
=end
```

I'll use this one to comment some parts of my code to run and test it. For example if I know some part of the code is working and the other on is failling: better understanding where it is failing.

#### Arithmetics in Ruby

6 arithmetics operators
* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)
* Exponentiation (`**`)
* Modulo (`%`)

So what does that mean?

if:
* my_num = 100
* my_num1 = my_num * 4
* my_num2 = my_num1/16

Then:
* my_num1 = 400
* my_num2 = 25 OR my_num2 = my_num/4

More maths below just for you, with examples

```ruby
sum = 13 + 379
puts sum
> 392
```

```ruby
product = 923 * 15
puts product
> 13845
```

```ruby
quotient = 13209 / 17
puts quotient
> 777
```

#### Data type in Ruby

There are three data types in Ruby that we're interested in right now: Numeric (any number), Boolean (true/false), and String ("random text").

Where you declare a variable `var_var` and give it a value `depending_on_type`

```ruby
puts my_num
puts my_bolean
puts my_string
```

#### Run and display Ruby informations

To launch a ruby script you created, you will have to run `ruby name_of_file.rb` in you [CLI](/tags/cli).

You can also use `puts` is the way to display/print something  from your script & it will output 2 lines. `puts` means `put strings` on its full length
> `puts` is the `print('value')` equilavent in Python

### Learning Ruby 102

Some might think it is too "simple", but remember that this is the second course of the Ruby 102, I took ✌️ 

#### Length in ruby

For the length in Ruby, you will use `.length`

```ruby
variable = "Testing the length of myvariable"
size = variable.length
puts size
```

Note that you could also directly add `"Testing the length of myvariable".length` in your script

```ruby
variable = "Testing the reverse of my variable"
size = variable.reverse
puts size
```

Note that you could also directly add `"Testing the reverse of my variable".reverse`

Why using `.reserve` => Reversing input can be useful if you want to sort a list of values from highest to lowest instead of lowest to highest.

#### Upper and lower cases

Yes, still simple as it could be, but remember this is an introduction to Ruby. So to print (`puts` if you follow) a string in uppercase you will use `.upcase` and to fo the same thing downcase it will be ( ... wait for it ... ) `.downcase`

```ruby
name = "Arthur"
name_uper = name.upcase
name_lower = name.downcase
puts name_uper
puts name_lower

> ARTHUR
> arthur
```

#### Varables: string and integer

```ruby
my_name = "Arthur" #String
my_age = 32 #Integer
```

### Learning Ruby 103

Let's something more tangible begin for this Ruby 103: strings and strings Methods

Two way of doing it:
* with several variable
* adding one method after the other one

=> It will lead to the same output

#### Strings and String Methods: One variable

```ruby
name1 = "Arthur".downcase.reverse.upcase
puts name1
```

Like an example we already saw before


```ruby
names = "Arthur"
names_lowercase = names.downcase
names_down_reverse = names_lowercase.reverse
names_down_reverse_up = names_down_reverse.upcase

puts names_down_reverse_up
```

### Learning Ruby 201

Let's go directly to the next step of this introduction (for me it was at least): launching the shell command.

In python you would use `python` or `python3`, in Ruby it's `irb` & it stands for `Interactive Ruby Shell`

## So in the end: what about Ruby?

In the end I was able to learn and understand Ruby ... but not build a tool in 2-3 days (obviously). It was great, I am feeling more comfortable understanding and making changes to our website (yeah part of the [Technical SEO](/tech-seo-what-is-it) priviledge is to modify Tech stuff 😅).

And in the end I used Python and Streamlit to build the app I had in mind: I am more familiar with [Python](/tags/python) and thanks to [SQL](/tags/sql) I was able to connect this tool with our exisitng ones.

## Want to hop on the train?

If you want to hop on the Ruby train: let's hit the Rails! You can follow the same introduction course I took on CodecAdemy, you could go to Udemy or go to Coursera or even RubyMonk (I will not list everywebsite available). There is a ton of ressources online to learn Ruby, including the one from the Ruby Foundation!

I will finish this article by sharing with you my (not mine directly) cheatsheet from CodecAemy: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby/modules/learn-ruby-introduction-to-ruby-u/cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby/modules/learn-ruby-introduction-to-ruby-u/cheatsheet)
