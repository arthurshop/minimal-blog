Let's say you have a dataframe (called `df`) and it is big. When big, I mean lots of columns and you would like how you can display them to filter you data frame for your analysis and cleaning.

Today tip and trick is to help you in your data analysis: displaying column names of your data frame

===
 ## Before begining

Since we will be using `pandas` Python library do to it: you will have to verify it is installed on you folder, computer or environement.

There are 2 solutions to install `pandas` depending on which version of Python you are currently running.

* For Python 2

```python
pip install pandas
```

* For Python 3

```python
pip3 install pandas
```

Note 1: if you are using a notebook like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, don't forget the `!` before `!pip` to make sure that it will launch the install

Note 2: you will only have to do this install process once, unless you are using different environement to work on.

## The next step: loading pandas (of course)

The next step after the install is to load the library

```python
import pandas as pd
```

> If you would like to know more about `import`, I invite you to read this article: [Importing a library in Python](/how-to-import-libraries-python)

## Afficher les columns grâce à pandas en Python

Remember we name our datafrane `df`, but if you named it otherwise, you will have to change the `df` mention below to the name of your dataframe.

```python
for col in df.columns:
  print(col)
```
So what does this 2 line of code are doing: for every column (`col`) in your dataframe (`df`), print (`print()`) the result.
